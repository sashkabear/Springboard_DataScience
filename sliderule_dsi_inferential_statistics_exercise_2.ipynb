    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "Based on sample data we estblished a 95% CI for the range of values for difference in callback proportions based on race that could be attributed to chance. This range gives us a reasonable basis for judgement of our measured z score. If the z-score of the difference in our samples is above 1.96, we can expect this to be a chance occurence in less than 5% of the cases, in other words - not likely. Since our measured z-score ~ 4.1, we can expect this result to be a chance occurence in <.003% of the cases, in other words - Extremely unlikely. Thus we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternate hypothesis - that there is in fact a difference in interview call back rates with respect to applicant's race."

    "While we did determine that the difference in callback proportions based on race is very unlikely to occur by chance, and that we can assume race does affect interview callback rates, we can not make a judjement on whether race in the most important factor without conducting additional analysis. From the data above we could check for variables such as: years of experience, age, number of jobs applied, etc, and see how they affect call back rates. It is also possible that certain important factors were not considered in the presented experiment - number of applicants per job, method of resume submission, number of contacts at the company, etc. While we can conclude that percieved race affects callback race, there could be a number of factors that influence employer's decision to a greater extent.\n"
